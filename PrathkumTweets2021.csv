"8. Async, await and promises

Async function is a function that returns some promise. A promise is a special JavaScript object that links the “producing code” and the “consuming code” together. Whereas await makes a function wait for a promise.",https://twitter.com/Prathkum/status/1407303520060067840,2021-06-22 11:44:40+00:00

A function passed as an argument to another function is called a callback if the function invokes the argument at a later time
